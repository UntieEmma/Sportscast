                <p>World Marathon record holder Kelvin Kiptum will be buried on Friday in his village in South-West Kenya.
                        The 24 year old died in a road accident two weeks ago alongside his Rwanan coach Gervais Hikizimana. 
                        Kiptum’s death comes after several tragic incidents which have claimed the lives of Kenya athletes in their prime.
                        In today’s Africa Daily, Alan Kasujja talks to former Boston Marathon champion Wesley Korir and asks if athletes are faced with greater risks outside the field of play.

                <p>EP.1023: Playing soccer on Kilimanjaro – Revised – Laura Youngson
                     Back in 2017 while setting on the couch and watching sports news coverage, Laura noticed the dismal amount of time dedicated to women’s sports. What struck her the most was “the fact that there are more stories about horses than women in the sports pages”. Being a proficient soccer player herself and experiencing the frustration of minimal coverage and general lack of opportunities, she decided to do something about it. A quick google Maps search few emails later, Laura devised a plan to elevate women’s sports higher than it has ever gone.
